# Squid (Proxy Server) in Docker

When the container is starting up, it will set username/password which loaded by [sec_file](https://github.com/sheng9571/shenker/blob/master/squid/sec_file) via [gen_auth.py](https://github.com/sheng9571/shenker/blob/master/squid/gen_auth.py) into squid htpasswd file.

When clients request to access squid service, squid service will recognize it's ip address. If the ip address is in our [white list](https://github.com/sheng9571/shenker/blob/master/squid/ip_white_list), and the squid service will ask clients for authentication.
